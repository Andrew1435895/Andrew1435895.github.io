## Favorite  CPSC 120L labs

  Lab 4, part-1: 
   
    This lab was fun for me because it was the first time we used functions in a complex way. Converting liquid values into smaller/bigger values in a function, 
  then using that infomation to convert it once again to get our desired value was interesting. It required me to really think on how to keep and move information 
  around in the code to end up with the calculation I wanted.

  Lab 6, part-2:

    This is another lab I found interesting because it was about BlackJack. Not only did this lab give me a refresher on how the counting system and the game works,
    but it also required me to think about how to use functions critically in order to count the score correctly.

  Lab 8, part-2:

    This was another personal favorite of mine because it asks you to write code in order to draw a specific shape/pattern. I thought the idea of using code to execute
    this task was very interesting and required me to approach this lab differently. It tested my overall knowledge of loops for me to code a program to draw the shape
    I needed.
